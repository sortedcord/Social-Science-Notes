# Classification of #Resources
## On the basis of origin-
- **Biotic #Resources:** These are obtained from the biosphere and are living. _Eg: Flora, Fauna, livestock_
- **Abiotic #Resources:** All those things that are non-living things present in the biosphere are called Abiotic Resources. _Eg: Rocks and metals._
## On the basis of Exhausitibility-
- **Renewable #Resources:** The resources that can be renewed or reproduced by physical, chemical and mechanical processes are known as renewable resources. 
- **Non-Renewable #Resources:** These occur over a very long geological time and take millions of years to form/replenish and can eventually get exhausted. _Eg: Minerals and Fossil Fuels_
## On the basis of Ownership-
- **Individual #Resources:** Owned by private individuals. _Eg: Plantaton, pasture lands, ponds, water in wells.
- **Community Owned #Resources:** There are resources which are accessible to all the members of the community. _Village commons, playgrounds, public parks_
- **National #Resources:** All the resourced within a country's geographical area belong to it. The country has legal powers to acquire even private propery for public good. _All the minerals, water resources, forests, wildlife, land within the political boundaries and oceanic area upto 12 nautical miles from the coast belong to the nation _
- **International #Resources:** Internation Resources are regulated by international institutions. _The oceanic resources beyond 200 nautical miles belong to open ocean and no individual country can utilise these without the concurrence of international institutions._
## On the basis of Status of Development-
- **Potential Resources:** Resources which are found in a region but not utilized. _Eg- Rajasthan and Gujrat have enormous potential for development of wind and solar energy, but so far these have not been developed properly._
- **Developed Resources:** Resources which are surveyed and thier quality and quantity has been determined for use.
- **Stock:** Materials in the environment which have the potential to satisfy the human needs but humans do not have the appropriate technology to access these. _Eg: Hydrogen is a rich source of energy but we currently do not have the technology to use it for this purpose._
- **Reserves:** Are the materials in the environment for which we have the technology to harness but aren't being used at the current moment. _Eg: River water can be used for hydroelectricty but it is only to a limited extent._

# Land Degradation
Continuous use of land over a long period of time without taking appropriate measures to conserve and manage it has lead to land degradation.

## Current Figures
- **130 million hectares of degraded land.**
- 28% = Forest Degraded area
- 6% = Saline and Alkaline Land
- 10% = Wind Eroded Area
 -56% = Water Eroded Area
 
 ## Land degradation in Various States
 1. **Mining and Fracking**: Mining sites abandoned after excavation work is complete, leaving scars and traces of over-burdening. *Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha*
 2. **Overgrazing**: In states like Gujrat, Rajasthan, MP & MH.
 3. **Over-Irrigation**: In states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh is the main cause for degradation due to water logging leading to an increase in salinity and alkalinity.
 4. **Cement Industry:** Mineral processing such as grinding of limestone for cement industry and calcite and soapstone for ceramic industry generate huge quantity of dust in the atmosphere.
 5. **Industrial Effluents:**  Industrial effluents regarded as wasts have seen an exponenial growth

# Land Utilisation 
Land can be used for the following purposes-
1. **Forests** 	Nearly 30% percent of Earth's land is covered with forests and natural growth/vegetation
2. **Land not available for agriculture**:
	* Barren and waste lands that are not suitable for agriculture.
	* Land put to non-agricultural uses, e.g. buildings, roads, factories.
3. Other Uncultivated Land (Excluding fallow land)
	* Permanent pastures as well as grazing lands
	* Land under misc tree crops groves
	* Cultruable waste land (Left uncultivated for more than 5 years)
4. Fallow Land
	* **Current Fallow:** Left uncultivated for 1 or less agricultural year
	* **Other than current fallow:** Left uncultivated for more than 5 agricultural years
5. **Net Sown Area:** Defined as the total area under cultivation
	* **Gross cropped area:** Area sown more than once in an agricultural year plus net sown area.

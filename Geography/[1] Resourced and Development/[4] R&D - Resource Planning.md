# Resource Planning
## Need for Resource Planning
Resource planning is used for the judicious usage of resources.
It is important in country like India as the availability of resource is very diverse.
- The states of Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh are rich in minerals and coal deposits.
- Arunachal Pradesh has abundance of water but lacks in infrastructural development.
- The state of Rajasthan is very well endowed with solar and wind energy but lacks in water resources.
- The desert of Ladakh has a rich cultural heritage but it is deficit in water, infrastructure and minerals.
This is why resource planning at national, state, regional and local levels is important.

## Steps for Resource Planning
* Identification and inventory of resources across the regions of the country. This involves surveying, mapping and qualitative and quantitative estimation and measurement of the resources.
* Evolving a planning structure endowed with appropriate technology, skill and institutional set up for implementing resource development plans.
* Matching the resource development plans with overall national development plans.

# Conservation of Resources
Resources are vital for any developmental activity however, reckless usage and over-exhaustion of these resources may lead to socio-economic and environmental problems.
## Gandhiji's take on resource Conservation
Gandhiji was very apt on his view regarding resource conservation.
- A very famous quote by him was - "There is enough for everybody's needs but not for anybody's greed"
- He placed the greedy and selfish individuals and the exploitative nature of modern technology the root cause of resource depletion at a global level.
- He wanted to replace mass production with production by the masses.
